# Problem definition

An adventure company wishes for us to develop an application that generates 
recommendations regarding the leisure activities it offers, based on weather conditions, the 
health status of potential clients, and the characteristics of the venues where these leisure 
activities can be enjoyed. The following aspects must be taken into account: 
-  If the individual is in full physical health and has not exhibited symptoms of infectious 
diseases in the past two weeks, they may participate in any of the activities offered. 
Otherwise, they will not be permitted to participate in any activity. 
- If the meteorological temperature is below 0 degrees, the relative humidity is less than 
15%, and there is precipitation (snow or rain), then it is best to stay at home. 
- If the meteorological temperature is below 0 degrees, the relative humidity is less than 
15%, and there is no precipitation (snow or rain), skiing-related activities may be chosen, 
provided the venue does not exceed the legal capacity limits. 
- If the meteorological temperature is between 0 and 15 degrees, and there is no rainfall, 
some hiking or climbing activities may be conducted, provided the expected venue does 
not exceed its capacity. 
- If the meteorological temperature is between 15 and 25 degrees, it is not raining, it is 
not cloudy, and the relative humidity does not exceed 60%, then any activity in the 
spring, summer, or autumn catalog may be carried out. 
- If the meteorological temperature is between 25 and 35 degrees, and it is not raining, 
the recommendation is to engage in cultural or gastronomic activities, respecting the 
corresponding venue capacities. 
- If the meteorological temperature is greater than 30 degrees, and it is not raining, the 
recommendation is to go to the beach or the swimming pool. The swimming pool must 
not exceed the legal capacity limits.
